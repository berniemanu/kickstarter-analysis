# Kickstarting with Excel
Using excel to analyse a large dataset and get hands on experience applying the advanced excel functions and features learnt in Module 1.

## Overview of Project
Analysing a 4,000+ crowdfunding projects, to find hidden trends about how different campaigns performed based on when they were launched and how successfully they reached their goals. 

### Purpose
Tell a visual story to Louise about how effective other theater and play campaigns fared compared to her successful campaign for her play "Fever". Easy to understand visual statistics will help Louise to plan successful future campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges
The module instructions made it easier to follow and do the analysis. However I had a little difficulty in understanding the CountIfs function , which I could overcome by reading and re-reading the instructions and applying it step-by-step in the project.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Theater Outcomes based on Launch date shows how successful, failed and canceled projects trended from January to December. This would help Louise to plan her future fundraisers at appropriate times.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Outcomes based on the Goals shows the rate of success, failure and cancellation based on the initial $ goals. This would help Louise to plan her future fundraisers with appropriate $ goals.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I had encountered challenge in matching the Outcomes Based on Goal Chart exactly with the instructions. With the help of my peers, I could identify a missing line item. Now my updated chart matches exactly like the one in the instructions.

## Results

### Timing the Fundraising
* Projects launched in the month of May had the highest success rate followed by June and July.
* Overall more theatre projects were launched during May, June, July and August compared to the rest of the year.
* Louise will have a high likelihood of a successful campaign if she targets to launch during May, June or July.

### Setting the right Goals
* 48% of the projects had goals ranging from $1000-$4999. 
* Projects with a goal below $5000 also enjoyed highest success rate averaging 74%. 
* Despite fewer projects with goals ranging from $35,000 to $45,000, these projects enjoyed second higher success rate averaging 67%. This shows that donors are discriminating and are willing to back a really good project despite the high goals. 
* That said, given Louise's goals, her likelihood of a successful campaign increases if it is <$5000.

### Limitations of this Dataset
* Goals and  pledged currencies are not uniformly translated across all the campaigns. This makes the comparison slightly like comparing apples to oranges when we are analysing and comparing campaigns including all currencies.

### Other possible tables, graphs and insights
* We can visualise the number of successful/failed projects based on goals.

* Theater category and Plays subcategory have the highest number of successful kickstarter campaigns among every other categories and subcategories.

![Subcategory Outcomes](https://github.com/berniemanu/kickstarter-analysis1/blob/main/Subcategory%20Outcomes.png)

* US Theatre kickstarter campaigns with goals averaging $5K have been successful compared to campaigns with goals averaging $10K.

* Edinburgh Frinch Festival analysis showed that campaigns with goals averaging $2K have been fully pledged with average donations ranging from $33-$51.

* Overall 25% of the campaign have no backers. Median campaign goals have been around $2K.
